        "### **What are the Key conecpts of Oops**\n",
        "In Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is centered around organizing code into classes and objects to promote modularity and reusability. The five key OOP concepts are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes and Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint or prototype that defines the attributes and behaviors (methods) of an object.\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class that contains data and can perform functions defined in the class.\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).\n",
        "Restricting direct access to some of an object’s components, often by making attributes private (using underscores, like _attribute), while providing public methods to access and modify them.\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "A mechanism to create a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class), inheriting its attributes and methods.\n",
        "Promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes (like a parent-child relationship).\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.\n",
        "Methods in different classes can have the same name but behave differently (method overriding and method overloading).\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "Achieved through abstract classes or interfaces, which provide a template for other classes without specifying detailed implementation.\n",
        "These concepts work together to make Python OOP code more modular, maintainable, and reusable."
